        "- A2A Communication: This project gave me practical experience with how Agent-to-Agent communication enables scalable coordination in multi-agent customer service architectures. By implementing distinct roles for routing, data retrieval, and support handling, I gained firsthand insight into how structured message passing, tool-grounded actions, and effective state management work together to create dependable automated workflows. Working with A2A message architecture deepened my appreciation for how distributed agents can collaborate, negotiate, and share context to tackle multi-step tasks in a controlled and transparent way.\n",

This protocol enables seamless interaction between agents and external systems while maintaining consistency and reliability.\n",

        "One of the primary challenges was debugging errors that occurred across multiple system layers. When issues arose, pinpointing whether they originated from the router's intent logic, an MCP tool malfunction, an agent-to-agent transfer problem, or a state transition within the graph proved difficult. This complexity pushed me to develop more comprehensive event logging, implement detailed message tracing, and create modular testing approaches. These improvements ultimately strengthened the overall system stability and made troubleshooting far more manageable."
